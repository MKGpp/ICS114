Write a pseudo-code algorithm that gets a positive integer, max,
from the user and then outputs the sum of the numbers from 1 to
max

    set sum to 0
    get number, max from user

    for number(max) times starting at 1(i) until you reach number(max)
        add (i) number to sum
        increment i

    print value of sum


Write a pseudo-code algorithm that outputs the largest of 5
numbers input by the user.

    set max to 0
    set num to 0

    for 5 times
        get number from user
        store number in num
        if num is bigger than max
            set max to num
            
    print value of max  


Write a pseudo-code algorithm that accepts 3 integers from the
user and outputs the largest of the three

    largestNum = 0
    
    for 3 times
        get number from user
        
        if numA is bigger than numB and numC
            numA is largestNum
        else if numB is bigger than numA and numC
            numB is largestNum
        else
            numC is largestNum    


Write a pseudo-code algorithm that accepts 3 integers from the
user and outputs the smallest of the three

    smallestNum = 0
    
    for 3 times
        get number from user
        
        if numA is smaller than numB and numC
            numA is smallestNum
        else if numB is smaller than numA and numC
            numB is smallestNum 
        else
            numC is smallestNum
            
Write a pseudo-code algorithm that outputs the factorial of an
integer given by the user.

    set product to 1
    get number, max from user

    for number(max) times starting at 1(i) until you reach number(max)
        multiply (i) number with prouct
        increment i

    print value of product
